# Unity Game Development Utilities

This repository contains various utilities developed for Unity, designed to simplify game development workflows. Below is a summary of the key utilities and systems included in this repository.

## Utilities

### Lootbox System
A system to implement lootbox mechanics in your game. It supports customizable drop rates, item pools, and rarity levels.

### Cards with Buff and Exchange System(Sprites are not included.)
A dynamic card system where cards can provide buffs to the player. Includes a card exchange mechanic, allowing players to trade cards for different rewards.

### Persistent Singleton MonoBehaviour
A Singleton pattern implemented as a MonoBehaviour, designed to persist across different scenes in Unity. Useful for managers or other persistent systems that need to stay alive throughout the game.

### Singleton Scriptable Object
A Singleton pattern using Scriptable Objects, useful for storing game data or configurations shared across multiple game instances.

### Rarity System (Materials not included)
A flexible system for defining and handling item rarities in your game, easily integrable with loot systems or inventory management.

### Daily Quest System
A daily quest system allowing for recurring tasks that reset each day. Supports different types of quests, tracking player progress, and reward distribution.

### Saving Game Data via JSON
A simple, scalable system for saving and loading game data using JSON. Supports complex data structures and is easily extendable.

## Libraries Used

- **BigDouble**: Utilized for handling large numbers, especially in idle or incremental games.
- **UniTask**: Used for asynchronous operations in Unity, providing a more flexible and efficient approach than traditional coroutines.
- **DOTween**: Used for handling animations and tweening in Unity, offering a powerful and easy-to-use system for smooth transitions.
- **Unity Localization Package**: Used to add different languages.
- **JSON .NET For Unity**: Used for saving game data between sessions.

## Note
Some utilities are dependent on others. Ensure all required dependencies are implemented when integrating multiple systems.

## How to Use

To integrate any of these systems into your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or copy the relevant scripts into your project.
2. Modify the systems as necessary to fit your gameâ€™s requirements.
3. Ensure you have the required libraries (BigDouble and UniTask) installed.
4. Attach the scripts to appropriate GameObjects.
